# Logo Generator
This is a homework assignment where I had to use the terminal to create a logo based on user input.

## Description
This logo generator is a simple logo creator based on user input and it creates an SVG file based on that input. 

## Visuals 
* ![Here is a screenshot](./assets/images/screenshot.png) Here is a screenshot of the created logo.svg

* [Link to video demonstration]()

## Usage
This is intended to create a simple logo so that a professional graphics designer is not needed. This is also for grading purposes.
